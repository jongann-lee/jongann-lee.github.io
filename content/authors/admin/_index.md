Welcome to my webpage!

I'm an aerospace engineer with an inherent love for vehicles like aircraft, cars, and trains. Currently I'm interested mobile robotics, reinforcement learning, safety in control, and in a more general sense, autonomy.

I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering at Seoul National University. There I conducted research on various novel controllers for autonomous aerial vehicles under the guidance of Professor Dongjun Lee. I was also president of the drone club Bulnabi, where I participated in the Korea robot aircraft competition.
